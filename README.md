# BlazorGenUI

This is BlazorGenUI. Framework for Blazor applications to generate simple UI from C# objects. Supporting both server-side and webassembly Blazor.

## Why this project
My main intention is to create generated UI from C# objects with working one-way binding from UI to object. Since Blazor is still relatively new framework, I was experimenting with its possibilities. This can be used to create scalable UI interfaces with often changing models. Also if you want to create fast simple UI from encapsulated DTO's objects of any kind, with simple possibility of adjustments you can generate UI.
